Task 2 (Optional)
Write several failing WebDriver tests (open browser, Assert.False).
Make a screenshot on a failure and save it to a folder.
After all the tests have passed, generate a HTML report,
which will show all the screenshots. Consider the following points:

Class which creates a screenshot should be placed separately;
do not fail if you cannot take a screenshot or save a file;
generate a filename: test name + random string;
filenames should not be too long or include restricted characters.
